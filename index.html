      <h1 class="target title">Hey I'm Dhafir, a web developer/SEO living in New York City. </h1>
      <h2 class="target subtitle"> Welcome to my<a href="project.html"> portfolio <span>→</span></a></h2>
				<p class="change">I am a Web Developer who enjoys the freedom of the internet and the space it creates for innovation. I work in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React. I'm currently based in the NYC-metro area and this gives me the opportunity to constantly network with others who share my passion. I'm motivated by a thirst for new technologies. I also love laughs,playing music, sports, pool, and new friendships. Feel free to contact me or browse some of my projects using the links below Each version was built using different technologies.</p>
				
				<p class="change">I enjoy the challenge of bringing tomorrow’s technologies to today’s marketplace. As a consultant I have pioneered SEO marketing strategies for emerging platforms - iPhone, Facebook, Twitter, Wordpress, mobile, etc. As a web developer focused on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node and React. I understand the tradeoffs between early adoption of technologies and lasting business impact. It's not enough to be first. A balance must be struck between innovation, sustainability and profit. Excellent relationship builder with a proven track record of closing deals. Results oriented thinker with constant focus on energing trends.
